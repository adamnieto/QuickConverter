## Requirements

- Git
- Python 3 (recommend 3.4)

<!-- ## Setup

1) Fork QuickLC3Converter. You'll have your own version of the repo at You/bikeshare with both the master branch and develop branch.

2) Create a virtual environment **and activate it**.

3) Install the app's requirements from requirements.txt using pip. **You may need to use pip3 to ensure you're running pip from Python 3.**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Install additional required components specified in bower.json using bower.

```
bower install
```

5) We have some scripts in the scripts directory for inserting test data to your local MongoDB database. Assuming you have the local database running, just run the script using Python 3.

## Running the app

First configure the app based on the environment you're running it in. If you are developing, you must set the `FLASK_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `development`.

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

To start the app simply run the following from the top level directory:

```
gunicorn app:app
```
